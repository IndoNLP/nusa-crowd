Code-mixed sentiment analysis of Indonesian language and Javanese language
using Lexicon based approach

Nowadays mixing one language with another language either in spoken or written
communication has become a common practice for bilingual speakers in daily
conversation as well as in social media. Lexicon based approach is one of the
approaches in extracting the sentiment analysis. This study is aimed to compare
two lexicon models which are SentiNetWord and VADER in extracting the polarity
of the code-mixed sentences in Indonesian language and Javanese language. 3,963
tweets were gathered from two accounts that provide code-mixed tweets.
Pre-processing such as removing duplicates, translating to English, filter
special characters, transform lower case and filter stop words were conducted
on the tweets. Positive and negative word score from lexicon model was then
calculated using simple mathematic formula in order to classify the polarity.
By comparing with the manual labelling, the result showed that SentiNetWord
perform better than VADER in negative sentiments. However, both of the lexicon
model did not perform well in neutral and positive sentiments. On overall
performance, VADER showed better performance than SentiNetWord. This study
showed that the reason for the misclassified was that most of Indonesian
language and Javanese language consist of words that were considered as
positive in both Lexicon model.
