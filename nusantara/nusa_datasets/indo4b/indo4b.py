            over the internet, the research progress on this language in natural language processing (NLP) 
            is slow-moving due to a lack of available resources. In response, we introduce the first-ever vast 
            resource for training, evaluation, and benchmarking on Indonesian natural language understanding 
            (IndoNLU) tasks. IndoNLU includes twelve tasks, ranging from single sentence classification to 
            pair-sentences sequence labeling with different levels of complexity. The datasets for the tasks 
            lie in different domains and styles to ensure task diversity. We also provide a set of Indonesian 
            pre-trained models (IndoBERT) trained from a large and clean Indonesian dataset (Indo4B) collected 
            from publicly available sources such as social media texts, blogs, news, and websites. 
            We release baseline models for all twelve tasks, as well as the framework for benchmark evaluation, 
            thus enabling everyone to benchmark their system performances.",

    Indo4B is a large-scale Indonesian self-supervised pre-training corpus

    covers both formal and colloquial Indonesian sentences compiled from 
    12 sources, of which two cover Indonesian colloquial language, eight
    cover formal Indonesian language, and the rest have a mixed style of
    both colloquial and formal.
